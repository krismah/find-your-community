# My Personal Project
***Find your commuter friends on campus!***

This application will allow commuter students on campus to find their community through the creation of a profile,
containing information related to their academic studies and their commute to campus, and be able to view and sort
other profiles based on various conditions (eg. year level, faculty, commute route, etc.). In addition, the application
will allow users to keep track of people (profiles) they're interested in connecting with through the use
of a list. This application is intended to be used by commuter students to find friends and community on campus!

This project interests me both as a commuter student to campus, but also as a Collegia Advisor with the UBC Collegia
program, which supports first-year students in their transition to university by creating a
home-away-from-home space that allows them to find friends and community on campus. In my role as a Collegia Advisor,
I've noticed that some students are not able to come to the space
due to conflicting schedules and commitments, resulting in a lack of social connection
with other commuter students. This application is designed to hopefully alleviate that issue and have a central
space for commuter students to find other commuter students!
